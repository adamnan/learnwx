# ----------- Exercises Below -----------------

#1. Did you figure out what was missing on line 4?
#   HINT: Does python know what a frame is automatically?

#2. Make that button print "Great! Me Too!" to the terminal when it is clicked.
#   Look back at the last lesson if you need to, but please don't copy-paste the code.
#   Typing it yourself will help you remember.

#3. Insert the following code on line 15.
#   wx.StaticLine(panel, pos=(100, 60), size=(220,2))
#   And, of course run the program to see what happened.

#4. Below the horizontal line, add more static text that says "This is more static text"
#   And then add a button that says "I don't like static text"
#   Make the new button print "Aww, too bad" to the terminal.
